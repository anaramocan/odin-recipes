For Recipes Project in Odin 
This current project that I am working on is located within the HTML foundations chapter of the Odin project. It is called "Recipes." 
I'm back after all that...I learned a lot! :) I created my main page to be the index.html and then added hyperlinks via the code format as follows <a href= 'recipes/abc.html"> 
These hyperlinks are connected to the newly created webpages I made in this assignment! I created 3 other webpages aside from the index.html page using the: "touch abc.html" code format
This creates a new file in whichever current directory I'm inside of (use pwd to see)
I found myself using "ls" to confirm that I did in fact create a new file in the directory
Then I switched back to VSCode to then create the boilerplate for the webpages
I linked them all on the index.html page in an unordered list so that they would NOT be on one line
This was a very helpful lesson!
